# Pyroyale - libRoyale Python Wrapper for Pico cameras

This is a python wrapper of libroyale, the API library of [PMD Pico depth sensors](https://pmdtec.com/picofamily/) (currently Pico Flexx, Pico Maxx, and Pico Monstar).

The wrapper is inspired by [mthrok's work](https://github.com/mthrok/libroyale-python-wrapper).

The wrapper is written in C++ and is based on the version 3.12.0.44 of the libroyale library.
